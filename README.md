PDF Merger
==========

This small utility library merges a pdf into multiple places of another pdf.
Underlaying, this uses lopdf (https://github.com/J-F-Liu/lopdf.git).
Compared to other (free) utilities, this library is able to manipulate large pdfs efficiently and
creates a small output file, if the same pdf is added in many places in a single pdf.
